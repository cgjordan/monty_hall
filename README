The Monty Hall Problem

Summary:
This puzzle was presented to me a couple of years ago by an acquaintance.  To most people, the answer seems impossible at first, and it was no different for me.  So I just disregarded it.
I was recently reminded of this puzzle and decided to write a little computer simulation to test it.  Sure enough, it demonstrates the answer to the puzzle.

The problem:
"Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, "Do you want to pick door No. 2?" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?"

The answer:
Staying with the door you originally picked gives you a 1/3 chance of getting the car.
Switching doors gives you a 2/3 chance to win the car.

Example output of the program:
Finished simulating 1000000 games.
Number of cars won by staying:   332741
Number of cars won by switching: 667259
